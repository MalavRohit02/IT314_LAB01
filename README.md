Q1.

Functional Requirements (FR’s) :


1. We should have a user-friendly UI interface which mimics a Physical Book Catalog with Card type objects representing Books 
   or more engagement and accessibility for users.


2. To borrow and return books with Ease by building a minimalistic system which focuses on allowing the members to register 
   for borrowing and returning the books,Along    with a dedicated Borrowing History and Upcoming Due Dates remainder schedule.


3. An option for users to extend their due date for the borrowing period, subject to if any other booking should allow members,
   to borrow and return books from their desks or chambers with ease and convenience.


4. Members should have the ability to extend the due date of their borrowings if no other booking for that particular book has been made.


5. A Search function should be there for members to easily find a specific book or browse through different categories (with the UI interface).


6. A Live System which updates the online catalog of the library's inventory, including book details such as,
   title, author, ISBN, and availability status in real time.


7. The Database of the website should integrate with the institute's student/employee database to ensure only valid users are able to borrow books, 
   this should also aid library staff in handling day-to-day book transactions with ease and efficiency.


Non - Functional Requirements (NFR’s) :


1. The web application should be developed using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, 
   to provide a visually appealing, user-friendly, and responsive interface.


2. The LIS should be designed to work within the institute's LAN, which reduces the risk of security breaches and,
   ensures that only authorized personnel have access to the system.


3. The LIS should be highly scalable and flexible to accommodate the library's growing needs and,
   handle a large number of concurrent users at the same time.


4. The system should be reliable, ensuring that it is available when needed, with minimal time required for maintenance and updates.


5. The System should be easy to maintain and update, with clear documentation and instructions for system administrators.


6. We can have a built-in security feature to prevent unauthorized access and protect the data, such as encryption for sensitive information.

7. It should have a performance testing in place, to ensure that the system can handle the expected traffic and usage, 
   and provide an acceptable response time for users.

8. For additional accessibility, The UI can have a feature to handle multiple languages due to a multitude of regional language texts, books and other resources.

Q2. 

Scope:

The scope of this project is to create a mobile application that addresses the everyday needs of individuals with disabling hearing loss.
The target audience is individuals with disabling hearing loss, which is approximately 5% of the world population or 466 million people.


Features:

1. The mobile application uses artificial intelligence to recognize key sound events of interest to the hearing-impaired community, 
   such as car horns and babies.
   
2. The app provides immediate alerts for these recognized sounds, as well as continual logging for the user.

3. The app is optimized for Android devices with low-latency to ensure real-time performance.

4. Integration with other assistive technologies, such as hearing aids or cochlear implants, to enhance the user's experience.

5. Customizable sound recognition settings, allowing users to select which sounds they want to be alerted about.

6. Option to connect with other users with hearing loss for support and networking.

7. A feature that allows users to record and save their alerts and sound events, so they can review them later or share them with their healthcare provider.

Non-Functional Aspects:

1. Security: User's information should be secured and protected from unauthorized access.

2. Performance: The app should have a high performance and be able to handle a large number of concurrent users.

3. Scalability: The app should be scalable and flexible to accommodate the growing needs of the target audience.

4. Reliability: The app should be reliable and available when needed, with minimal downtime for maintenance and updates.

5. Usability: The app should be user-friendly and easy to navigate.

6. Compatibility: The app should be compatible with the latest versions of Android.

7. Language Support: The app should support multiple languages to cater to a diverse user base.
